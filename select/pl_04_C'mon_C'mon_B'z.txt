When you walked in the room
I thought I'd forgotten you
Turns out it isn't true
After all
And now I do regret
All the things I said
I can't take this anymore
I want you
I'm telling you
Oh,oh
C'mon c'mon,I know I was wrong
Throw my hands up
And take the blame
I still believe in you and me
Do you feel the same
I'm sitting there
Waitin' for you
And baby I can't ignore you
I just adore you and
I can't get you Outta my head
C'mon,c'mon,c'mon,c'mon
Ooooooo
I'll do overtime
Just to make you mine
I can't remember why
I left you behind
Things that I shoulda done
I was having too much fun
Why did I let you go?
I want you
And I'm telling you
Oh,oh
C'mon c'mon,I know I was wrong
Throw my hands up
And take the blame
I still believe in you and me
Do you feel the same
I'm sittin' there
Waitin' for you
And baby I can't ignore you
I just adore you and
I can't get you outta my head
C'mon,c'mon,c'mon,c'mon
Ooooooo
Ooooooo
I was such a fool
Oh,I was so damn cruel
But I'm willing to change
I wanna be your man again
C'mon c'mon,I know I was wrong
Throw my hands up
And take the blame
I still believe in you and me
Do you feel the same
I'm sitting there
Waitin' for you
And baby I can't ignore you
I just adore you and
I can't get you outta my head
C'mon,c'mon,c'mon,c'mon
Ooooooo
